SNHU CS320 Software Test Automation
- **How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
The way that I can ensure my program is functional and secure by running multiple tests around certain areas of the program
to ensure that function is working the way that is supposed to work. If the tests come back as a failure, then the program requires
us to go back to the drawing board and figure out what went wrong and what worked. Testing is crucuial before we decide to
give the green light of deployment for the software.

- ** How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
I interpret the user needs by scooping up all of the necessary requirements that the user(s) ask of us and put them into the
program by incorporating certain rules via variable declaration, loops, and of course if-else statements to help further
follow along the user's needs.

- **How do I approach designing software?**
I approach designing software with the sense of curiosity. I want to get a clear understanding with the stakeholders about what they
want for their software and also what they dont want. Once I get a clear understanding in that regard, the other people that I work
with I want to help them understand the stakeholder's views so that we can easily tackle on the project and hopefully it won't
take us much time to deliver the stakeholders their desired software.
